<h2>Hi there !!</h2>

<div>
  <p>
  Hello!  <span> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> </h3></span> My name is Ali and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in high school when I used to spend my days making hover animations for fun — turns out those animations taught me a lot about HTML, CSS & JS!


Fast-forward to today, and I'm still exploring the immense web dev world. My main focus these days is the craziest and most diverse apps in terms of technologies used while being accessible, inclusive,Friendly and professional at the same time.


In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale — performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.


Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
 <ul>
   <li>
      Express.js
   </li>
     <li>
      React
   </li>
     <li>
      Node.js
   </li>
     <li>
      Firebase
   </li>
     </li>
     <li>
      MongoDB
   </li>
  </ul>


 



 



Let's make something special
